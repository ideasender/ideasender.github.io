        "phase_4_8_0" : "You can break rocks.",

        "phase_4_9_0" : "Really?",

        "phase_4_10_0" : "Yeah! Rock is solid. But, if it's hit by water continuously it will break into smaller pieces.",

        "phase_6_3_0" : "It's huge and seems so scary.",

        "phase_6_4_0" : "Don't worry Moola. Seems like it can't move",

        "phase_6_4_1" : "What you need to do is just keep hitting.",

        "phase_6_6_0" : "Hey! You are the Sun. You can speak?",

        "phase_6_7_0" : "Hhha. Actually, the wind and water also can't speak, right?",

        "phase_6_8_0" : "Hhha. Correct. So! What is it, Sun?",

        "phase_6_9_0" : "I can help you to break that rock.",
        "phase_6_9_1" : "I have a role that influences the climate in the world.",
        "phase_6_9_2" : "Some climate can help to deform the rock, but some of it is not.",

        "phase_6_10_0" : "How can we know?",

        "phase_6_11_0" : "Hmm. I'll show the clue on your screen.",

        "phase_6_12_0" : "Let's Start!!",

        "phase_7_1_0" : "Whoaaa!! Finally we arrived at the sea again.",

        "phase_7_2_0" : "I want to show you something.",

        "phase_7_3_0" : "What's that?",

        "phase_7_4_0" : "That process that we did actually already happened for years.",
        "phase_7_4_1" : "And it has a huge impact.",
        "phase_7_4_2" : "Before this this land look like this",

        "phase_8_1_0" : "And now it looks like this.",

        "phase_9_1_0" : "Wow!! It is so much different. Why can it be like that?",

        "phase_9_2_0" : "Ya, deforming rocks like we did is called Erosion. And when it happens for years it can change the landscape.",

        "phase_10_1_0" : "It's a good journey Moola.",

        "phase_10_2_0" : "Yeaa! Let's do that again.",

        "phase_10_3_0" : "I don't know if we can meet again or not.",

        "phase_10_4_0" : "What do you mean?",

        "phase_10_5_0" : "There are so many water particles and wind here.",
        "phase_10_5_1" : "We can't choose which water particle we will meet.",

        "phase_10_6_0" : "Ok! Thanks for your help Windy. Good Bye.",

        "phase_10_7_0" : "Good Bye Moola!!!",

        "phase_11_1_0" : "Wow..seems like something huge is coming",

        "phase_11_2_0" : "It's huge amount of water!!!",

        "phase_12_1_0" : "That's amazing. More water will give more energy to break the rocks",

        "phase_12_2_0" : "Yes, besides water, wind and climate, chemical also give huge influence on breaking rocks",

        "phase_12_3_0" : "Oh wow. This journey really give me so much insight. Can't wait to take another journey",

        "phase_13_1_0" : "Fiuhhh, that rocks are very thick",
        "phase_13_1_1" : "I hope i can have another power to destroy it easily",

        "phase_13_2_0" : "Hmm.. hey look around you",
        "phase_13_2_1" : "Now we are down deep in the ground. And we are on the magma path",

        "phase_13_3_0" : "What is magma?",

        "phase_13_4_0" : "Hot fluid or semifluid material below or within the earth's crust from which lava and other igneous rock",
        "phase_13_4_1" : "With some pressure. It can have energy to destroy rock around it",

        "phase_13_5_0" : "Wow! Thats amazing",

        "phase_13_6_0" : "Yes, just try to jump to the magma to get its energy",

        "phase_14_1_0" : "That's cool!!",

        "phase_14_2_0" : "It's not over yet",
