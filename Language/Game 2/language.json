	"opening_0": "Hello there, welcome to the Garden Family! Here, we will breed animals and grow some plants.",
	"opening_1": "It's really hard for me to do this all alone, so I will need your help!",
	"opening_2": "Here are some animals & plants to take care of the garden.",
	
	"firstdeer_0": "What you need to do is give them what they need. Easy, right?",
	"firstdeer_1": "Wait until the animals and the plants show what they need.",
	"firstdeer_2": "And then, just drag the item in the box below to the designated animal/plant.",
	"firstdeer_3": "All the items that you need are prepared in the box!",
	
	"firstdeernext_0": "Good Work!",
	"firstdeernext_1": "But don't work slow, or else the animals will run, or worse -- the plants will die!",
	"firstdeernext_2": "Trash cards and unneeded cards: put it into the red recycle bin to make spaces for new cards!",
	
	"firstgrow_0": "Whoa, the goat is growing!",
	"firstgrow_1": "Just like the other animals, goats will grow if they live long enough while consuming sufficient foods.",
	"firstgrow_2": "Thank you for giving them what they need. Keep up the good work!",
	
	"firstdeergrowdifferentstructure_0": "At some point, animals will grow while having changes in their body structure.",
	"firstdeergrowdifferentstructure_1": "Just as you can see in this goat, it has undergone several different feature changes.",
	"firstdeergrowdifferentstructure_2": "I'm very curious to see how big animals can grow!",
	
	"firstplant_0": "Hey, I bought a new plant! You'll have to take care of it differently from animals, though.",
	"firstplant_1": "Just like other living organism, it will also grow if they live long enough.",
	"firstplant_2": "Take good care of it and soon we'll see how it grows!",
	
	"firstduck_0": "Look at these little ducks. Aren't they cute?",
	"firstduck_1": "Fun fact: they grow differently from goats! Ducks come from an egg, while goats are born directly from its mother.",
	"firstduck_2": "Let's take care of them and see how they grow later!",
	
	"firstplantgrow_0": "Do you want to know more about plants?",
	"firstplantgrow_1": "Plants grow differently from animals. Do you know what are the differences?",
	"firstplantgrow_2": "First of all, it started as a seed,",
	"firstplantgrow_3": "After it got enough minerals from soil and water, it will become a sprout.",
	"firstplantgrow_4": "If they live long enough, they will grow bigger! Each plant grows differently, but usually they will have roots, stems, leaves and sometimes fruit.",
	
	"deergrowfinalstructure_0": "It's reaching its adult state. Look at how brave it is!",
	"deergrowfinalstructure_1": "Beside different looks, it has also grown on the inside. Look at the growth of its bone.",
	"deergrowfinalstructure_2": "It is larger than before, that's why some of their body parts are getting larger, too.",
	"deergrowfinalstructure_3": "Great job so far. Let's find out more about animal growth!",
	
	"finalgame_0": "Time sure flies when we worked hard, huh?",
	"finalgame_1": "Itâ€™s the last 30 seconds for us!",
	"finalgame_2": "Good luck and wish you all the best!",
	
	"finalgameend_0": "Finally, that's it! It has been very fun taking care all of this together with you.",
	"finalgameend_1": "But now it's time to say goodbye.",
	"finalgameend_2": "I hope you learned a lot while playing this game with me. You did a great job!",
	"finalgameend_3": "Thanks for helping me out, and let's play again sometime!"
